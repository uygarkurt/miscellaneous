This is a messy repository. There are small cryptography projects and other small projects. I did them while taking basic CS courses so
they are not super cyrptography programs. Non-cyrptography ones are self exploratory.
These codes are usable by anyone. I just recommend to understand them before using.

Knowledge should be shared.
